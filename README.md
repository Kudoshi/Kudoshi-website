A website where I post all my projects and activities

- Made in React
- Uses JSON to store project information
- Github Page for hosting the website

Note:
- All images should be in ideally 1280x720 or 16:9 ratio
- Pictures will be cropped or skewed otherwise

Future Expansions:
- Integrate Linkedin or social media activity to the main page
- Display Github Page statistic in website
- Project Post creation tool
- Prettify the UI
